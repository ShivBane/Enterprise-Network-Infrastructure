# 🚀 **Enterprise Secure Network Infrastructure**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
The **Enterprise Secure Network Infrastructure** is a scalable, secure, and efficient network architecture designed for corporate environments. This project integrates advanced security mechanisms, optimized routing strategies, and high-performance switching to ensure seamless communication and data protection.

---

## 🏛 **Architecture Overview**
### 🔹 **Key Components:**
- **Routers:** Cisco 1941 Series (Enterprise-grade security and routing)
- **Switches:** Cisco 2960 Series (Managed VLAN-supported switches)
- **Servers:** HTTP, FTP, and SYSLOG for monitoring and data storage
- **End Devices:** PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, and Printers
- **Wireless Infrastructure:** Secure enterprise-grade Wi-Fi network

### 🔹 **Network Segmentation:**
- **Enterprise LAN (192.168.1.0/24)** → End-user devices and internal services
- **Core Backbone Network (10.0.0.0/30, 20.0.0.0/30)** → Secure inter-router communication
- **Data Center & Remote Access (192.168.10.0/24)** → Servers and remote workstations
- **Wireless & Mobile Access (192.168.30.0/24)** → Managed Wi-Fi & mobile connectivity

## 🔒 **Security Implementation**
### 🔹 **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
- Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity
- Generates real-time alerts for potential security threats
- Logs stored in the SYSLOG server for auditing

### 🔹 **Firewall & Access Control Policies:**
- **ACLs** (Access Control Lists) configured on routers
- **Stateful Firewalls** applied to protect internal resources
- **MAC Filtering & WPA2 Encryption** for Wi-Fi security

---

## 📡 **Routing & Switching Optimization**
### 🔹 **Routing Protocols:**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Enables dynamic and efficient routing
- **Static & Default Routing:** Implemented for redundancy and control

### 🔹 **VLAN Segmentation:**
- VLANs configured for different traffic types (User, Server, Security)
- Traffic isolation ensures better security and performance

### 🔹 **Performance Enhancements:**
- **QoS (Quality of Service):** Prioritizes critical network traffic
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic efficiently across routers and servers
